## Installation

### For Claude Code (CLI)

#### Method 1: Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)

The easiest way to install skills. Add this marketplace once, then install any skill you want:

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ThepExcel/claude-skills

# Step 2: Install the skills you want
/plugin install deep-research@thepexcel-skills
/plugin install triz@thepexcel-skills
/plugin install problem-solving@thepexcel-skills
```

**List all available skills:**
```bash
/plugin list thepexcel-skills
```

#### Method 2: Install Single Plugin from GitHub

Install a specific skill directly without adding the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin add ThepExcel/claude-skills/plugins/deep-research
```

#### Method 3: Manual Clone + Symlink

For full control or offline access:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/ThepExcel/claude-skills.git
cd claude-skills

# Create symlinks to make skills globally available
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
for skill in plugins/*/; do
    ln -s "$(pwd)/$skill" ~/.claude/skills/$(basename "$skill")
done
```

After installation, Claude Code will automatically use these skills when relevant.

### For Claude.ai (Web)

**Step 1: Download the skill folder**

Choose one of these methods:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Download entire repo** | Click green **Code** button → **Download ZIP** → Extract → Find the skill folder in `plugins/` |
| **Use download tool** | Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/) → Paste folder URL (e.g., `https://github.com/ThepExcel/claude-skills/tree/main/plugins/deep-research`) |
| **Git clone** | `git clone https://github.com/ThepExcel/claude-skills.git` → Copy the folder from `plugins/` |

**Step 2: ZIP the folder**

```bash
# ZIP the entire folder (not just the files inside!)
zip -r deep-research.zip plugins/deep-research/
```

**Step 3: Upload to Claude.ai**

1. Go to **Settings > Capabilities**
2. Scroll down to **Skills** section
3. Click **Upload skill** and select your ZIP file

> **Important:** ZIP must contain the folder structure. If you ZIP only the files, Claude won't find SKILL.md!
>
> **Requirements:** Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan.
