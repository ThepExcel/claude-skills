# Skill Extractor

Extract domain expertise from experts and transform it into production-ready Claude skills.

## What is This?

Skill Extractor is a Claude skill that guides you through structured conversations to capture your expertise and turn it into a working Claude skill. It's perfect for:

- Subject matter experts who want to share their knowledge
- People with specialized workflows they want to automate
- Anyone who wants to create custom Claude skills

## How It Works

The extraction process has 4 phases:

1. **Domain Discovery** (15-20 min) - Understand what expertise exists and how to package it
2. **Expertise Extraction** (30-45 min) - Deep dive into your knowledge through strategic questions
3. **Structure Design** (15-20 min) - Organize knowledge into clear, usable structure  
4. **Skill Creation** (20-30 min) - Generate production-ready skill files

Total time: ~60-90 minutes

## What You Get

After the extraction session, you'll receive:

- **SKILL.md** - Main skill file ready to install
- **Reference files** - Supporting documentation (if needed)
- **Examples** - Real-world usage scenarios (if applicable)

Everything packaged and ready to use!

## Installation

1. Download the skill-extractor folder
2. Add it to your Claude skills directory
3. Start a new conversation with Claude
4. Say: "I want to extract my expertise into a skill"

## Example Use Cases

- **Workflow skills**: "I have a process for cleaning messy data in Power Query"
- **Coaching skills**: "I want to create a coach for learning a new language"
- **Knowledge bases**: "I have best practices for API design"
- **Hybrid skills**: "I have a comprehensive approach to UX research"

## The Persona: น้องฟ้า

By default, the extraction is guided by น้องฟ้า - a warm, curious interviewer who makes the process feel like a friendly conversation. You can customize the persona anytime by asking!

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific**: Share concrete examples and real scenarios
- **Think out loud**: Share your mental models and decision-making process
- **Don't hold back**: Include "obvious" things - they might not be obvious to others!
- **Bring examples**: If possible, have examples of your work ready to reference
